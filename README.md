This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in Python related to handling potential zero division errors. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code that fails to account for division by zero in various scenarios, leading to unexpected outputs or runtime errors. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that addresses this issue gracefully.  This is particularly relevant for beginners and those working with numerical data.
